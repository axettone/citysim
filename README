This is an experimental city economy engine written in C.

It is in a preliminary development status, so it's not usable.

To run the main loop, launch the main executable src/citysim.

At this stage I'm working on the main loop and try to figure out
some kind of algorithm to process the city economy, but I'm also
creating and refining the data structures.
